# Functional Domain Modeling Sample (Compilable)

This is a minimal Maven project that compiles the core examples from the lecture.

## Requirements
- Java 21+
- Maven 3.9+

## Build

```bash
mvn -q -f docs/samples/functional-domain-modeling/pom.xml test
```

## Notes
- The sample is intentionally small and focused on compile-time safety, not full behavior.
